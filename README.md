## What Is Tracer and Why Use It? 
Tracer is a monitoring solution designed to optimize HPC workloads for speed and cost efficiency. It consists of a one-line install Linux agent and instant dashboards that provide real-time insights into scientific computing environments.

This is made possible by Tracer‚Äôs unique approach to devops data structuring. Currently users lack a structured view of individual pipeline stages and execution runs. It is difficult to determine which processes or containers belong to the same pipeline or track how performance evolves over time, espescially in environments like AWS Batch.

Tracer solves this by intelligently organizing and labeling pipelines, execution runs, and individual steps. 

What's unique is that Tracer runs directly from your Linux operating system, so it works with any programming language and requires no code changes, making integration into existing workflows effortless. 

Architected specifically for regulated industries, Tracer ensures enterprise-grade security, keeping all data within your infrastructure while requiring no ongoing maintenance.

## Key Features 
New metrics that help you speed up your pipelines and maximize your budget:
- Time and cost per dataset processed
- Execution duration and bottleneck identifcation for each pipeline step
- Cost attribution across pipelines, teams, and environments (dev, CI/CD, prod)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è More Powerful Capabilities:
- Unified Monitoring: Track all your HPC pipelines in a single, centralized dashboard
- Faster Debugging: Identify CPU, RAM, and I/O bottlenecks instantly, and never lose AWS Batch container logs again
- Optimization & Savings: Spot computional waste and cut costs by up to 45% in computational biology workloads
- Enterprise-Grade Security: Airgapped deployment keeps all data within your infrastructure
- Upcoming Roadmap:
    - Q1 2025: Advanced Cost Attribution
    - Q2 2025: Performance Optimization for HPC
    - H2 2025: Automated Error Database

## Quickstart Installation
### 1. Install Tracer With One Line of Code
Run the following command to install Tracer on your Linux Ubuntu system:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tracer.cloud/installation-script.sh | bash && source ~/.bashrc
 ```
### 2. Initialize a Pipeline
Set up your pipeline by specifying a name:
```bash
tracer init --pipeline-name <YOUR_PIPELINE_NAME>
 ```

### 3. Infrastructure Setup  
You can run a single command from this repository to provision the required infrastructure:
- AWS account with access to a PostgreSQL database
- Grafana instance (Amazon Managed Grafana recommended)

```bash
cd infrastructure && terraform apply
 ```

### 4. View Instant Dashboards 
Run the following command to retrieve your dashboard URL:

```bash
tracer info
 ```
