## What Is Tracer and Why Use It? 
Tracer is a monitoring solution designed to optimize HPC workloads for speed and cost efficiency. It consists of a one-line install Linux agent and instant dashboards that provide real-time insights into scientific computing environments.

What's unique is that Tracer runs directly from your Linux operating system, so it works with any programming language and requires no code changes, making integration into existing workflows effortless.

Architected specifically for regulated industries, Tracer ensures enterprise-grade security, keeping all data within your infrastructure while requiring no ongoing maintenance.

## Key Features 
Gain unparalleled insights into your HPC pipelines with metrics that help you speed up your pipelines and maximize your budget:
- Time and cost per dataset processed
- Execution cost per pipeline run

More Powerful Capabilities:
- Unified Monitoring: Track all your HPC pipelines in a single, centralized dashboard
- Cost Attribution: Track cloud costs across pipelines, teams, and environments (dev, CI/CD, prod)
- Faster Debugging: Identify CPU, RAM, and I/O bottlenecks instantly, and never lose AWS Batch container logs again
- Optimization & Savings: Spot computional waste and cut costs by up to 45% in computational biology workloads
- Enterprise-Grade Security: Airgapped deployment keeps all data within your infrastructure
- Upcoming Roadmap:
    - Q1 2025: Advanced Cost Attribution
    - Q2 2025: Performance Optimization for HPC
    - H2 2025: Automated Error Database

## Quickstart Installation
### 1. Infrastructure Setup  
Get started in minutes. Ensure you have:
- AWS account with access to a PostgreSQL database
- Grafana instance (Amazon Managed Grafana recommended)

You can run a single command from this repository to provision the required infrastructure:

```bash
cd infrastructure && terraform apply
 ```

### 2. Install Tracer With One Line of Code
Run the following command to install Tracer on your Linux Ubuntu system:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tracer.cloud/installation-script.sh | bash && source ~/.bashrc
 ```
### 3. Initialize a Pipeline
Set up your pipeline by specifying a name:
```bash
tracer init --pipeline-name <YOUR_PIPELINE_NAME>
 ```
### 4. View Instant Dashboards 
Run the following command to retrieve your dashboard URL and open the link to access real-time insights into your computational workloads
