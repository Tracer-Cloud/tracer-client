## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features 
Gain unparalleled insights into your HPC pipelines with key performance indicators:
- Time and cost per dataset processed: Optimize resource usage and efficiency
- Execution cost per pipeline run: Track and control cloud spending to reduce costs. Helping you speed up pipelines and maximize your budget

![Tracer Dashboards](docs/images/20250316-kpi-dashboard.png)

More Powerful Capabilities:
- Unified Monitoring: Track all your HPC pipelines in a single, centralized dashboard
- Cost Attribution: Track cloud costs across pipelines, teams, and environments (dev, CI/CD, prod)
- Faster Debugging: Identify CPU, RAM, and I/O bottlenecks instantly, and never lose AWS Batch container logs again
- Optimization & Savings: Spot computional waste and cut costs by up to 45% in computational biology workloads
- Enterprise-Grade Security: Airgapped deployment keeps all data within your infrastructure
- Upcoming Roadmap:
    - Q1 2025: Advanced Cost Attribution
    - Q2 2025: Performance Optimization for HPC
    - H2 2025: Automated Error Database
