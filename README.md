## What Is Tracer and Why Use It? 
- Tracer is a system-level observability platform purpose-built for scientific computing. It combines cutting-edge technological advances with‚Ä®the deep understanding of scientific industries to give insights into their speed and costs.
Its one-line install Linux agent and instant dashboards allow for real-time insights into scientific computing environments.

- Unlike industry agnostic monitoring agents, Tracer structures DevOps data for scientific pipelines, providing clear visibility into pipeline stages and execution runs. In environments like AWS Batch, where processes and containers are loosely connected, users struggle to understand which processes belong to which pipeline run, and frequently lose logs from failed containers, making debugging difficult.

- Tracer solves this by intelligently organizing and labeling pipelines, execution runs, and steps. Because it runs directly on Linux, it requires no code changes and supports any programming language, unlike point solutions that work only with one framework. This makes integration effortless even across multi-workload IT environments, including AlphaFold, Slurm, Airflow, Nextflow and also local Bash scripts.

- Architected for regulated industries, it ensures enterprise-grade security, with data never leaving your infrastructure, which is not the case with solutions such as DataDog.

## Key Features 
New metrics that help you speed up your pipelines and maximize your budget:
- Time and cost per dataset processed
- Execution duration and bottleneck identification for each pipeline step
- Cost attribution across pipelines, teams, and environments (dev, CI/CD, prod)
Overall, making sense of scientific toolchains with poor/no observability.

## Quickstart Tracer

We recommend using the Sandbox Environment for an easy ans quick onboarding experience: https://sandbox.tracer.cloud/

Click the ‚ÄòGet started‚Äô button and follow the guided steps‚Äîno AWS credentials or setup required.



### 1. Install Tracer With One Line of Code

Install Tracer with this single command:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tracer.cloud/ | sudo bash && source ~/.bashrc && source ~/.zshrc
```
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tracer.cloud/installation-script-development.sh | sudo bash && source ~/.bashrc && source ~/.zshrc
```
To get the binary corresponding to the dev branch you just have to put `-s dev` after the bash command like in the following example
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tracer.cloud/installation-script-development.sh | sudo bash -s dev && source ~/.bashrc
```
To get your pr binary use `bash -s <branch-name>` like in the following example
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tracer.cloud/installation-script-development.sh | sudo bash -s feature/my-branch && source ~/.bashrc
```

Click the 'Open In Github Codespaces' button to use GitHub Codespaces.

Once in Codespaces, the environment comes with:
Tracer pre-installed and Docker running a minimal Nextflow example. Here, you need to run the tracer init command showcased in the next step.



### 2. Initialize a Pipeline

Set up your RNA-seq pipeline by running the following command and run Tracer:
```bash
tracer init --pipeline-name demo_username --environment demo --pipeline-type rnaseq --user-operator user_email --is-dev false 
 ```
Then you need to run a Nextflow command example.


### 3. Monitor your Pipeline

Watch your pipeline in action via the Tracer monitoring dashboard, which you access by clicking the ‚ÄòOpen Grafana Dashboard‚Äô button.
You‚Äôll see real-time execution metrics, stages, and status updates.
