## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the `tracer` client, we encourage you to report it responsibly.

Please email the maintainers at **security@tracer.cloud** with the subject line:

[SECURITY] Vulnerability Disclosure for Tracer

Do not open a public GitHub issue.
We will respond promptly and work with you to investigate and, if confirmed, address the issue as quickly as possible.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are currently provided in new releases.
As Tracer is currently in early development, we reserve the right to introduce breaking changes while progressing toward a stable release.

| Version | Supported               |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| < 1.0   | ✅ Latest release only   |
| 1.0+    | ✅ Latest minor versions |

## Security Process

Once a vulnerability is reported:

1. The team triages the issue privately.
2. If valid, a GitHub Security Advisory will be created.
3. A patch is prepared, reviewed, and tested.
4. Once ready, a new release is issued with a public disclosure.

We follow responsible disclosure practices to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed before details are shared publicly.

## Contact

If you have any further questions about security practices at Tracer, you may contact us at the email above.

## Security Mitigations and Roadmap

See [docs/SECURITY_ROADMAP.md] for information on any security issues that have been mitigated, and a general roadmap for future security improvements.
